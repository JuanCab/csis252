NOTE: This file is not part of the typical distribution.  It is here only
to give some notes about the purpose of the distribution.

This distribution demonstrates multiple things
1) modularization (putting functions in separate files)
   - function prototypes
2) makefile (to make compiling and linking of modules more convenient)
3) using a header file for constants
4) documentation including a README file
